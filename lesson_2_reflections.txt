What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git repository is created.
We need to do this because a .git repository is required to create the previous versions of files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is what will be stored in the .git repository and not the contents from the working directory.
The value it offers is that we don't have to store everything everytime. We can just save whatever is in the staging area.
